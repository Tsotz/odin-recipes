    <h2>What is iskender kebap?</h2>
    <p>This Iskender kebab is similar to one I tried at a Turkish restaurant in London. It is traditionally made with lamb or doner meat but this chicken version is delicious. I later discovered that this dish was named after Alexander the Great, whom the Persians called "Iskender." Apparently, it was his favorite food.</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pita bread rounds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>ground cumin to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup süzme (Greek) yogurt</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange pita bread on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake pitas in the preheated oven until lightly toasted; cut into bite-sized pieces and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, onion, and garlic; cook until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato purée; season with cumin, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook and stir for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange toasted pita pieces in a serving dish. Drizzle with melted butter and top with chicken mixture. Garnish with yogurt and parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>
